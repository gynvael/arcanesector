# Arcane Sector
A Dragon Sector CTF old-school (MMO)RPG Game.

**NOTE**: The rest of this README file might contain incomplete/outdated/inaccurate information. One thing that is correct though, is the network packet description.

## Design
Arcane Sector is a multiplayer old-school 2.5D RPG game. Almost all logic for the game is server-side (on a CTF each team should get their own server, so the teams don't influence each other / don't oversee a solution to a task when another team is solving it). The client is implemented in C++ (it's not a setup for a pwn challenge though, C++ is chosen for speed, so the implementation should be as flawless as possible - not saying it is, but it should be) with an API-agnostic graphics engine (i.e. all graphics are done on frame buffers in memory). There are two I/O systems present in the client - SDL2 (desktop) and JS/WebSocket (thin client).

Initially on the CTF the players got access only to the web version (video/audio/keyboard/mouse is proxied) and had to get access to a `backup.zip` file containing the client + an incomplete server (only the flag files were missing though). Only then MOST of the challenges were solvable.

## Glossary

   * **PC** - Player Character

## Visuals

The game uses a pseudo-3D view typical for old school RPGs like Ishar, Eye of Beholder, Dungeon Master, etc. The pseudo-3D is rendered by an actual software 3D engine (OK, in retrospect not using OpenGL/Vulkan wasn't a good idea), which supports some (but not all) typical 3D operations. For example it can do fog and texturing, but can render only certain types of axis-aligned quads - this is actually enough to render a game of this type while keeping the code relatively short (the whole 3D stuff is actually just 350 lines of code).

The initial idea was that the 3D view will be rendered in 428 x 240 pixels, but will be upscaled to whatever the actual window size (with pixelization) - this is done to maintain the old-school feel of the game.

Some random technicalities about the pseudo-3D:

    * The 3D coordinates are in meters - all the math has been calibrated for this.
    * The ground level is on Y=0m, and the player's eyes are 1.8m above the ground (that's actually -1.8m, since everything above the ground is expressed in negative numbers).
    * The player stands a short step (0.5m) behind the tile center - this actually gives a nice view of the current tile and enough space to e.g. render items on it.

### Rendering order

There are 5 stages of rendering, 4 of which have Z-buffer filled but not checked and cover the floors/ceilings, and the last one which fully uses the Z-buffer and handles all and any vertical surfaces (and also is rendered in reverse order - from from to back - to take advantage of the Z-buffer).

The list below contains information on what is rendered in which stage (note that stage N+1 is rendered on top of stage N).

    * **Stage 0**: Water.
    * **Stage 1**: Grassland, forest ground, wood floor.
    * **Stage 2**: Sand, Rocky roads.
    * **Stage 3**: Dirt roads.
    * **Stage 4**: Building / mountain walls, trees, items.

## Map

Technically there are two maps kept in sync - the server-side map, and the client-side map, both of which are generated using `export-world.py` script from the Tiled (mapeditor.org) map format (with additional preprocessing done on the export).

The common part is a 512 by 768 tile map, where each tile on the map represents a 5m x 5m square (so the main map has about 2.5km x 2.5km in size, or 6.3km<sup>2</sup> of area).

As mentioned in the Visuals section, the player will see the world standing in the middle of a tile (actually half a meter back from the middle), looking in either North, South, West or East direction. We assume that North-South is the Y axis, with North being on the lower values and South on the higher. Similarly West-East is the X axis, with West being lower values and East higher. The tile in the North-West corner of the map is (0, 0).

The full map size is 512 x 768 tiles, with the upper 512 x 512 being the main terrain map, and the bottom 512 x 256 (aka supplementary part) being used for insides of buildings, caves, etc (so entering a building through the door is actually teleporting to the supplementary part).

The client-side map contains additional 8-bit of information per tile about the tile variant (this is tile specific, e.g. which forest tile to use) - this information is automatically generated during the export phase base on a set of preprocessors. Additionally selected static item information (door, cave entry, etc) is also added these 8 bits for some tiles (building walls, cave walls, etc).

The server-side in addition to the base tile plane also contains two lists of objects:

    * The "items" list contains whereabouts of static items (like signs, doors, decorations, etc).
    * The "system objects" list contains information about location-bound system processors/event generators like e.g. monster/item spawns.

### Client-side map additional information

This part contains documentation related to the nature of the 8 bits of additional data in the client-side map file.

#### Forest

    * Bits 0-2: Number of trees in the tile (0 means one tree, 4 means five trees).
    * Bits 3-5: Slot set selector (tree position randomization seed basically).
    * Bits 6-7: Type of forest (pine trees, leaf trees, dead trees or a mix).

## Protocol

### Common parts
Each an every packet begins with these three fields:

| Offset (hex) | Type / Size  | Name       | Description
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------
| 0            | uint32_t     | sz         | Packet length (excluding the common part)
| 4            | char[4]      | chunk_id   | Chunk ID (4 capital letters)
| 8            | uint64_t     | packet_id  | Response to this packet (if any) will have the same value here
| **10**       | ← **total size**

The packet length cannot be larger than 1 MB.
Note that the packet_id is just echoed in replies (if any) by the server. There is no sanitization needed.

Apart from that the following types are used:

#### string
A data+length string.

| Offset (hex) | Type / Size  | Name       | Description
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------
| 0            | uint16_t     | sz         | String length
| 2            | char[sz]     | text       | String data
| **2+sz**     | ← **total size**

#### item
Any item in the game. A special id `~0` means "no item" (e.g. empty inventory slot, etc) - in this case no other fields exist in the packet.

| Offset (hex) | Type / Size  | Name       | Description
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------
| 0            | uint64_t     | id         | Item unique ID (~0 is a non-existing item)

### Goodbye (C→S) "GBYE"
Sent when the client is exiting. The server should gracefully close the connection at this point. This is somewhat a workaround for the problem of net.join() hanging for 60 seconds on client-initiated exit (might be related to not thinking about this when implementing packet parsing and then not wanting to re-write the networking code - ups). So it's basically a server-assisted goodbye.

### Ping (C→S) "PING"
Sent every 30 seconds by the client.

*This packet has no additional data.*

### Pong (S→C) "PONG"
Sent in reply to PING.

## Thin client packet protocol

    * TC - Thin Client
    * C - Client/Renderer


Websocket based. Packet IDs:

    * (C→TC) Anything with lowest bit 0 - keyframe (including the ID!)
    * (C→TC) 0x01 - diff frame
    * (C→TC) 0x03 - cursor (16-bit int w, h, hot_x, hot_y, followed by image data; if w and h are 0 it means default cursor)
